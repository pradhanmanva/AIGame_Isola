# Isola

Isola is a two-player board game. It is played on a 7x7 grid which is initially filled with squares on each cell. 
Both players have one piece; it is in the middle position of the row closest to his/her side of the board.

A move consists of two subsequent actions: 

1. Moving one's piece to a neighboring (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) position that contains a square but not the opponent's piece. 
2. Removing any square with no piece on it. 

The player who cannot move his/her piece loses the game.
